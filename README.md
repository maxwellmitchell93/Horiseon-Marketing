# Horiseon-Marketing
## Description
- The motivation for this project is to refactor an existing site for Horiseon Marketing angency and make it more accessible for their users. 
- I built this project for Horiseon Marketing to help them refactor their webpage to meet accessibility standards.
- The main problem with the website was accessibility. I added atl attributes, so the site is now more accessible to ensure people with disabilities can access the website. Another problem was the code not following a symantic structure with HTML. Now the HTML is organized and follows symantic structure using symantic HTML elements. The heading attributes fell out of sequential order. now they fall in a logical order
- There was no title for the webpage, so I added a concise, decriptive title called Horiseon Marketing.
- During this project I learned that having a website that meets accessibility standards is a very important part of web development
